# Snake DQN Project


Implemented a DQN agent to play the game "Snake", the environment being written using pygame, and the training/ML part with Pytorch.

Added requirements.txt, needed to run the file properly, if not, you have to separately install the dependencies of this project listed on the txt. 

Playing as human requires all of the lines in 'if __name__ == "__main__":' to be commented, but the first two lines, "game = SnakeGame()" and "game.play_human()".
